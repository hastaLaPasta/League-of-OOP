       League-of-OOP
 =========================
          
  An implementation of a MMO game in Java. The map on which the game is played
is a 2D rectangle consisting of unit size locations ("squares"). Each location
has a certain set of properties; the types of locations are:
   + Land
   + Volcanic
   + Desert
   + Woods
  
  The types of heroes available in LOOP are:
    + Knight
    + Pyromancer
    + Rogue
    + Wizard
  They all have a number of hit points (HP, also known as "life") and a number of
experience points (XP). There is also a level-up mechanism based on the experience
you have gained.
  All characters have XP initially = 0, corresponding to level 0. At level 0 all skills
have only the base effect. When a character wins a fight (kills his opponent), his XP will
increase according to the following formula:
    XP_Winner = Xp_Winner + max (0, 200 - (Level_winner - Level_loser) * 40)

  As you can see from the formula, winning a fight with an opponent that is at least 5 lower
levels will not bring any more XP, but winning in front of a higher level opponent can even
make more than 200XP .

  The XP thresholds required to make the level-up will be calculated according to the formula:
    XP_level_up = 250 + level_curent * 50
  At level up a hero will return to 100% HP.
   
  Each type of hero has a certain set of abilities whose parameters or effects depend on the land
on which the land modifiers are and the character they act on (race modifier). The amplifiers are
multiplier, whether the ability give flat damage or percentage of opponents stats!).

   + ABILITTIES:
   
   # Execute - damage in the current round or, if your opponent has an HP

   + base damage: 200, + 30 / level
   + HP limit: 20% * the maximum theoretical life of the victim at her level; +1% / level,
              up to a maximum of 40%

   + percent: 20%, + 5% / level
   + HP base: min (0.3 * OPPONENT_MAX_HP, OPPONENT_CURRENT_HP)
              ⇒ damage = percent * min (0.3 * OPPONENT_MAX_HP, OPPONENT_CURRENT_HP)
   + The modifiers below apply to the percentage variable. They are multiplicative, for example
     if we have a Wizard level 4 (⇒ 40%) and it applies Drain on a rogue, have a total percentage
     of 40% * 0.8 = 32%, therefore the formula for calculating the damage is:
     damage = 0.32 * min (0.3 * OPPONENT_MAX_HP , OPPONENT_CURRENT_HP).

      Rogue -20%
      Knight + 20%

     Game mechanism
   ------------------

  The game is based on rounds. In one round, all the characters perform one (well determined) movement,
and if two reach the same location, they are struggling. A struggle works as follows: each hero will
calculate the parameters of his or her own skills, depending on their level and the ground they are at.
Then each skill will be modified according to the victim. After applying skills, the heroes will calculate
their new HP and XP as needed, after which the round ends.
